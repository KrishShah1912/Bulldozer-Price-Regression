# Bulldozer-Price-Regression
This project tackles the challenge of estimating the auction prices of used bulldozers based on historical sales data. Leveraging regression techniques and real-world datasets, it demonstrates how machine learning can bring efficiency and insight to the construction equipment resale market.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of forecasting bulldozer sale prices based on usage, equipment type, and auction data. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow

# 📦 Features
* ✅ End-to-end pipeline: Data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference
*📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual insights into temporal trends, equipment usage, and price distributions
* 🧠 Model: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
* 📈 Evaluation: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error) and cross-validation
* 📁 Jupyter Notebook: Clear step-by-step documentation for learning and iteration

# 📈 Model Performance
* Metric Used: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error)
* Baseline RMSLE: ~0.50
* Final Model RMSLE: ~0.25 (after tuning and feature engineering)

# 🧠 Key Learnings
* Handling time-series data and missing values effectively
* Importance of domain-specific feature engineering (e.g., equipment age)
* Using cross-validation to avoid overfitting
* Building reproducible and modular ML workflows
